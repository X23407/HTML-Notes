    <pre style="font-size: larger;">
        Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
        I'm in the bathroom looking at me
        Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Wait until the reaper takes my life
        Never gonna get me out alive
        I will live a thousand million lives (ooh-ooh-ooh)

        My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
        Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

        I got this feeling, yeah, you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        I got this feeling in my soul
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones

        Playin' with a stick of dynamite
        There was never gray in black and white
        There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
        Seein' all the vultures circlin'
        Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
        Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'

        My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
        Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

        I got this feeling, yeah, you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
        I got this feeling in my soul
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones

        Look in the mirror of my mind
        Turnin' the pages of my life
        Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
        Drown out the voices in the air
        Leavin' the ones that never cared
        Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky

        My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
        My patience is waning, is this entertaining?

        I got this feeling, yeah, you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
        I got this feeling in my soul (soul)
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        There goes my mind, (I) don't mind
        There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
        There goes my mind, (I) don't mind (there it goes)
        There goes my mind (there it goes)
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
